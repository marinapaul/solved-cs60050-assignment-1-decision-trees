 <li>Build a decision tree by taking as input a maximum depth and by randomly splitting the dataset as 80/20 split i.e., 80% for training and 20% for testing. Provide the accuracy by averaging over 10 random 80/20 splits. Consider that particular tree which provides the best test accuracy as the desired one.</li>
